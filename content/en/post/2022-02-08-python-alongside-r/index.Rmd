While working on my PhD thesis I'm usually facing the situation when I need to use both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages. 
*R* offers me the possibility to render neat scientific supports with [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package, which bring `.Rmd` support. 
Obviously, *Python* has similar format ([`pymarkdown`](https://python-markdown.github.io/) and the `.Pmd`) available, it is not as well developed as the *R* counterpart. 
Moreover, I'm far more familiar with *R* statistical libraries, [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite and coding practices. 
However, at the same time I need *Python* dependencies: the most developed *neural network* (NN) libraries are written in *Python* or have their main interface in *Python*. 
For example, the well known [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) has a *Python* based backend. 

The idea behind this post is to describe the possibilities to combine both *R* and *Python* in your workflow. 
There will quite a lot of disjoined materials available on internet in this post, leaving not that much place for my personal contribution. 
But I hope it might be useful for someone, and I expect to convert the results into a guide for the TER's and other courses I'm giving.



## Configuring `reticulate` 

One of the most developed packages for *R* and *Python* interactions is the `rticulate`. 
It offers several possible strategies of interaction between the languages, among which:

- Calling *Python* directly from *R*
    + Sourcing *Python* scripts
    + Including *Python* chunks in *RMarkdown*
    + Using *Python* directly from within an *R* session
- Translation between *R* and *Python* objects
- Interactions between the different versions of *Python* through virtual environments

The `reticulate` is provided as CRAN package to be installed with *R*:

```
# Install reticulate
install.packages("reticulate")
```

The package uses the *Python* version found on your PATH by default. 
So if you already have a working *Python* installation there is nothing to do. 
However, given the *Python* language specifics I suggest you use a separate environment to use alongside your *R* installation. 
One of the good practices is to use a [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) virtual environment, or *Python* `virtualenv`. 
If you desire to configure a separate *Python* installation, the `reticulate` package offers such possibility via `miniconda` installation. 
This may be achieved with a simple command:

```
# Install miniconda
reticulate::install_miniconda()
```

The `miniconda` will be installed in the default, system specific, path. 
To modify it, one can set environmental variable `RETICULATE_MINICONDA_PATH`. 
After the installation do not forget to verify that `conda` is in your PATH and activated. 

An existing *Python* installation can provide similar experience through `virtualenv` functionality. 
To create a new virtual environment execute:

```{r reticulate}
# Call reticualte
library(reticulate)
```

```
# Create new virtual environment
virtualenv_create("r-environemnt")

# Tell reticulate what to use
use_virtualenv("r-environment")
```

To ensure the correct detections of the desired default *Python* installations by `reticulate` you may want to define `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environmental variable. 
Finally, you may verify the activated environment's configuration with:

```{r py_config}
# Configuration info
py_config()
```

Once the *Python* is setup and `reticulate` detects the desired environment, we may proceed to the description of usecases.

## Interacting with *Python*

As you could see, there exist multiple strategies to interact with *Python* from inside *R*. 
In order to better illustrate how exactly the interaction between *R* and *Python* is performed it's better to start with `REPL` path. 

### Calling *Python* `REPL` from within *R*

This first option allows us to switch between *R* and *Python* sessions in terminal and access shared objects. 
For those who do not know what `REPL` is here is a [short definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop):

> A **read–eval–print loop** (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user ...

We can access *Python* `REPL` interface directly from *R* by running:

```
# Call Python REPL
repl_python()
```

We can then interact with *Python* session as we would typically do, as if *R* did not exist. 
What is more, we can reach *R* objects, created in our *R* session. 
All such objects are accessible from within `r` object in *Python* session. 
To return back into *R* session we can execute command `exit` or `quit`. 
Then, in our *R* session we would be able to reach previously created *Python* objects as parts of `py` object. 
A quick example:

Now it becomes more clear how the different interfaces interact through dummy objects `py` and `r`

### Importing *Python* modules into *R*

Another option, if you do not want to switch between different languages and interpreters is to load (or `import`) *Python* modules inside *R*. 
This can be done via `import()` function. 

```{r import}
# Import numpy
os = import("os")

# List directory contents with Python toolset
os$listdir(".")
```

As one can see, the *Python* libraries are imported into *R* as separate objects with desired functionalities inside. 

### Sourcing *Python* code from files

The same principles may be used with scripts. 
Meaning you can write the desired *Python* script for importing data or session setup into a standalone file and then source it from within your *R* session. 

For example, we can create a short script creating a new variable, and save into a file:

```{r cat}
# Write into file
cat(
    "import os\nld = os.listdir('.')", 
    append = FALSE,
    file = "script.py"
)
```

And then call it from within our *R* session, and print results:

```{r script_run}
# Source Python script
source_python("script.py")

# Results
py$ld
```

### *Python* chunks inside `.Rmd`

The final option is brought to us alongside `rmarkdown` format functionality. 
In particular, we can simply create entire *Python* chunks inside `.Rmd` file. 
It remains only to specify the correct language in chunk's parameters:

````
```{python chunk_0}
import os
os.listdir(".")
```
````

The general idea behind this method is common to all other methods. 
We can access the objects created within *Python* chunks in *R* chunks and vice versa:

```{python c0}
# Import os
import os

# Check directory contents
dc = os.listdir(".")
```

Then we can access the results from within *R*:

```{r c1}
# Print results
py$dc
```
