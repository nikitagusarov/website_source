My name is Nikita Gusarov and I'm currently doing my Doctoral studies at the University Grenoble Alpes located in France. 

{{< figure src="/images/grenoble_night.png" >}}

My work is primarily focused on exploration of the performances of *Discrete Choice Models* (DCM) in modelling individual behaviour. 
This is a rather breathtaking topic, because of its interdisciplinary nature. 
I have to deal at the same time with different techniques from quite distant fields, among which: 

- *Statistics*
- *Econometrics*
- *Machine Learning*
- *Combinatorics and Optimisation*

As well as various behavioural theories, specific for several domains:

- *Economics*
- *Psychology*
- *Preference Learning*

Recently I've taken interest as well in the quite distant topics, such as *system administration*, *workflow organisation* and *project management*, making focus on the FOSS solutions at the same time.
