While reworking the *DCE Simulation* package for my Thesis, I've discovered one more interesting topic to speak about. 
We have already seen how to create a package, write documentation and implement OOP in *R*. 
Now it comes the time of *Metaprogramming*. 
But don't be afraid of this unfamiliar term, we are going to see that the concepts behind it are fairly simple.

Most of the materials presented are adopted from [this mazing book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/meta-big-picture.html) about advanced *R*. 
My task here is mostly the vulgarisation of the material. 



## Metaprogramming 

What is *metaprogramming* exactly? 
Because in this post we attempt to make things as accessible as possible, let's take a definition [from here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming):

> **Metaprogramming** is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to *treat other programs as their data*. 
> It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

At this point you probably ask yourself why ever we may need this functionality? 
The answer is quite simple: we develop an OOP based simulation package. 
It means that such paradigm allow us to flexibly create objects (ex: artificial individuals) using *metaprogramming*. 
This way we no longer need generating our "*robots*" with some sort of wrapping functions and directly assigning the characteristics within our population. 
Instead we would be able to create flexible classes of individuals described by the *data generation procedures* instead of the *characteristics* alone. 

> Generic programming invokes a metaprogramming facility within a language by allowing one to write code without the concern of specifying data types since they can be supplied as parameters when used. 

This is exactly the feature we need for our simulation package's user interface. 

## What do we need?

The main dependency for our exercise today is the [`rlang`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) package. 
Generally, it adds two frameworks to the base *R*:

- `tidy eval`, a *data-masking* framework, which is heavily used by `tidyverse` suite
- `rlang errors`, a toolset for error signalling and reflection

Obviously, it's the first  feature that we need the most. 
If you already have `tidyverse` installed on your machine then it means that you already have `rlang`. 
We should only attach it to our active environment:

```{r rlang}
# Load dependecies
library(rlang)
```

## Working with `rlang`

There exist several key concepts to keep in mind, when attempting to use *metaprogramming* in *R*.

### Defusion

The first concept we should explore is the *defused expression*. 
As it's described on the [official package's website]():

> (The) **defused expressions** can be thought of as blueprints or recipes for computing values.

Let's take as an example some blatantly simple expression: 

```{r expr_0}
# Let's create some data
x = c(1, 3, 5)

# Expression
mean(x)
```

As expected, *R* will calculate the result and display it for us. 
Now we store the same sequence as an *expression*:

```{r expr_1}
# Store our expression
meanx = expr(mean(x)); meanx
```

What has just happened is that *R* stored the entire expression in the memory without executing it. 
It means that from now on we can call this expression by addressing the object it was stored in: 

```{r expr_2}
# Calculate mean of x
eval(meanx)

# Recreate x and rerun calculations
x = c(2, 4, 6); eval(meanx)
```

As you can notice, reevaluating the expression after data recreation affects the result. 
For now it may look similar to writing a custom function to run over the data, but in fact the scope of usability differs a lot between two. 
In particular, you can see some advantages of the *defused expressions* by using them to wrap the argument within function. 

At this pint we should understand how `enexpr()` function works. 
It is required to convert arguments passed to a function into `expr()` object, to interpret the user input as an expression.  
For example, let's create a function which simulates 100 observation of given law and then calculates the mean (yes, it's quite useless as function, but it's good for exercise):

```{r enexpr_0}
# Fuction creation
mean_rand = function(law = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)) {
    # Number of observatoins
    n = 100
    # Generate vector
    x = eval(enexpr(law))
    # Calculate mean
    mean(x)
}

# Run function with default args
mean_rand()
```

An interesting feature to add to the above example is the possibility to avoid specifying the `n` argument. 
This is possible, because we can modify our saved expressions as any other *R* object. 
Meaning we can run:

```{r expr_3}
# Fuction creation
mean_rand = function(law = rnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1)) {
    # Number of observatoins
    n = 100
    # Add n declaration ot law
    law = enexpr(law); law$n = n
    # Generate vector
    x = eval(law)
    # Calculate mean
    mean(x)
}

# Run function for exponential law with 'rate = 2'
mean_rand(rexp(rate = 2))
```

This particular feature allow to make your functions more *user friendly*. 
It's equally possible to modify the expressions arguments by position using `[[` syntax. 

### Data-masking (*injection* and *embracing*)

At this point it is important to speak about the *data-masking* functionality introduced by `rlang` package. 
As stated by [package's authors](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-data-mask.html):

> **Data-masking** is a distinctive feature of R whereby programming is performed directly on a data set, with columns defined as normal objects.

Let's use the default `mtcars` dataset for illustration. 
First we use the standard programming style, typically used for simple data analysis:

```{r dm_0}
# The default style (unmasked programming)
var(mtcars$mpg + mtcars$qsec)
```

Now let's see the approach with *data-masking*:

```{r dm_1}
# Data masking
with(
    mtcars,
    var(mpg + qsec)
)
```

At first it seems as rather uncomfortable way to work (the function `with()` exists in `base` *R* since 2001). 
But it becomes more convenient once you start sing special operators `{{}}` (*embracing operator*) and `!!` (*injection operator*). 
What do these operators do exactly?

- **Injection** (or *quasiquotation*, `!!`) allows you to modify parts of a program. 
Technically it's a wrapper around *defused code* specifically designed for usage with `data.frame` objects. 
- **Embracing** (`{{}}`) is a further extension of the *injection*. 
In fact it combines both `enquo()` function with *injection* operator (`!!`). 

Because it's the first time you see the `enquo()` function 
(or `enquos()`, which is a vectorised version of the former), 
it's time to precise that it serves for *code defusal*. 
What is the difference with `expr()` and `eval()` one may ask. 
The `expr()` function creates an object of type `call`, which can be then evaluated using `eval()`. 
The `enquo()`, creates a special object of type `quosure`. 
In short, as described in [the documentation](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-quosure.html):

> A **quosure** is a special type of defused expression that keeps track of the original context the expression was written in.

Let's see how *injection* and *embracing* work before proceeding with `quosure` class description. 
The first option is to create a `quosure` and the inject it into our code:

```{r injection}
# Injection inside function
col_mean = function(data, arg) {
    # Convert argument to quosure
    arg = enquo(arg)
    # Get mean
    x = dplyr::select(data, !!arg)[,1]; mean(x)
}

# Test on mtcars
col_mean(mtcars, mpg)
```

To simplify the procedure, we can directly inject the argument using *embracing*:

```{r embracing}
# Injection inside function
col_mean = function(data, arg) {
    # Get mean
    x = dplyr::select(data, {{ arg }})[,1]; mean(x)
}

# Test on mtcars
col_mean(mtcars, mpg)
```

As mentioned before, there are some differences between `expression` and `quosure` objects. 
The `quosure` class contains both the information about the *expression* to be executed and the *environment* reserved for this expression. 
The later adds some more complexity and features to our code, because *environment* indicates where all the private functions of your package are defined.
