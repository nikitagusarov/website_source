<p>Today’s’ experience with helping to submit an article for a journal of <em>Taylor &amp; Francis</em> group was educative and energy draining at the same time.
Yesterday was quite a long day dedicated to styling the document, while now I had only figures to worry about.
Later, I’ll definitely have to write some guide about academic writing and how <code>R</code> software, which can be useful in this aspect.
But now lets speak about some useful tips in using <code>tikz</code>.</p>
<p>In <code>RMarkdown</code> there are several options on how to integrate <code>tikz</code> graphics into a document.
When generating a LaTeX output, the simplest way is to embed the LaTeX code inside the document.
While working with other formats, the only solutions is to use <code>tikz</code> environment provided by <code>RMarkdown</code>.</p>
<pre><code>`` `{tikz, fig.cap = &quot;Figure&quot;, fig.align = &quot;center&quot;}
*Latex code here*
`` `</code></pre>
<p>In order to be able to use this environment one will need to have <code>magick</code> and <code>pdftools</code> <code>R</code> packages installed.
The first one depending on <code>magick++</code> library<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, while the second requires <code>libpoppler</code> files to run<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
But this is not the topic for today.</p>
<p>On the first place among today’s discoveries that are worth mentioning we have the possibility to place the <code>nodes</code> on drawn lines.
Here is a simplified example of the resulting figure:</p>
<pre class="tex"><code>% Loading dependencies
\usetikzlibrary{
  positioning,
  arrows.meta
}

% Main picture
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [
    % Boxes
    box/.style = {
      rectangle,
      draw = black, 
      rounded corners, 
      minimum height = {3em},
      align = left
    },
    % Circles
    circ/.style = {
      circle,
      draw = black, 
      fill = white,
      minimum size = {3em},
      thin,
      align = center
    },
    % Arrow line
    arrowl/.style = {
      -{stealth},
      very thick
    },
    % Text nodes (separate from boxes)
    textn/.style = {
      align = left
    },
    % Node distances
    node distance=5mm and 2mm
  ]

  % Draw curved line with circles on it
  \draw[arrowl] (0,4) .. controls (1,2) .. (0,0)
    node[pos=0.3, circ] (a) {1}
    node[pos=0.7, circ] (b) {2}
  ;

  % First rectangle frame
  \node[box, right=of a, minimum width={50mm}] (a1) {};
    % Text inside the frame
    \node[right, align=left] at (a1.west) {
      \textbf{Header 1}\\
      Some text
    };
  
  % Second frame
  \node[box, right=of b, minimum width={50mm}] (b1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (b1.west) {
      \textbf{Header 2}\\
      Some more text
    };

  % Drawing supporting lines
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (a)--(a1);
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (b)--(b1);
\end{tikzpicture}</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Another interesting point is the embedding of drawing arrows with intermediate anchoring point, uniting several segment into a chain.
This option makes it possible to draw complex arrows with multiple turning points.</p>
<pre class="tex"><code>% Loading dependencies

<p>Finally, this experience was not only useful for learning some new <code>tikz</code> tricks, but for working with tables as well.
For example, I believe everyone knows that it’s possible to embed <code>itemized</code> lists inside <code>tabularx</code> environment.
However, it is possible to do the same thing with usual <code>tabular</code> environment as well!
Unfortunately, to show this example I’ll need to find a solution on how to easily include TeX generated output inside html document with the possibility to add supplementary LaTeX packages.</p>
