Today's' experience with helping to submit an article for a journal of *Taylor & Francis* group was educative and energy draining at the same time. 
Yesterday was quite a long day dedicated to styling the document, while now I had only figures to worry about. 
Later, I'll definitely have to write some guide about academic writing and how `R` software, which can be useful in this aspect. 
But now lets speak about some useful tips in using `tikz`.

In `RMarkdown` there are several options on how to integrate `tikz` graphics into a document. 
When generating a LaTeX output, the simplest way is to embed the LaTeX code inside the document. 
While working with other formats, the only solutions is to use `tikz` environment provided by `RMarkdown`.

```
`` `{tikz, fig.cap = "Figure", fig.align = "center"}
*Latex code here*
`` `
```

In order to be able to use this environment one will need to have `magick` and `pdftools` `R` packages installed. 
The first one depending on `magick++` library^[On Debian based systems `deb: libmagick++-dev`.], while the second requires `libpoppler` files to run^[On Debian based systems `deb: libpoppler-cpp-dev` work flawlessly.].
But this is not the topic for today. 

On the first place among today's discoveries that are worth mentioning we have the possibility to place the `nodes` on drawn lines. 
Here is a simplified example of the resulting figure: 

```{tikz, fig.cap = "Nodes anchored on a curved line", fig.align = "center"}
% Loading dependencies
\usetikzlibrary{
  positioning,
  arrows.meta
}

% Main picture
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [
    % Boxes
    box/.style = {
      rectangle,
      draw = black, 
      rounded corners, 
      minimum height = {3em},
      align = left
    },
    % Circles
    circ/.style = {
      circle,
      draw = black, 
      fill = white,
      minimum size = {3em},
      thin,
      align = center
    },
    % Arrow line
    arrowl/.style = {
      -{stealth},
      very thick
    },
    % Text nodes (separate from boxes)
    textn/.style = {
      align = left
    },
    % Node distances
    node distance=5mm and 2mm
  ]

  % Draw curved line with circles on it
  \draw[arrowl] (0,4) .. controls (1,2) .. (0,0)
    node[pos=0.3, circ] (a) {1}
    node[pos=0.7, circ] (b) {2}
  ;

  % First rectangle frame
  \node[box, right=of a, minimum width={50mm}] (a1) {};
    % Text inside the frame
    \node[right, align=left] at (a1.west) {
      \textbf{Header 1}\\
      Some text
    };
  
  % Second frame
  \node[box, right=of b, minimum width={50mm}] (b1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (b1.west) {
      \textbf{Header 2}\\
      Some more text
    };

  % Drawing supporting lines
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (a)--(a1);
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (b)--(b1);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Another interesting point is the embedding of drawing arrows with intermediate anchoring point, uniting several segment into a chain. 
This option makes it possible to draw complex arrows with multiple turning points.


```{tikz, fig.cap = "Multi-segment arrow example", fig.align = "center"}
% Loading dependencies
\usetikzlibrary{
  positioning, 
  fit, calc,
  arrows.meta
}

% Main picture
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [
    % Main box style
    box/.style = {
      rectangle,
      draw = black, 
      rounded corners,
      inner sep = {3pt},
      minimum width = {width("Subframe title:")+2pt}, 
      minimum height = {3em},
      align = left
    },
    % Empty box for empty space
    emptybox/.style = {
      rectangle,
      draw = white, 
      text width = {width("Subframe title:")+2pt}, 
      minimum height = {3em},
      align = center
    },
    % Arrow style
    arrowc/.style = {
      -{stealth},
      very thick,
      rounded corners = 5pt
    },
    node distance=1mm and 10mm
  ]

  % First node group
  %% Header
  \node[emptybox] (a) {\textbf{Title 1}};
  %% Subframes
  \node[box, below=of a] (b) {
    Subframe title:\\
    \texttt{h1ozghkcj4}
  };
  \node[box, below=of b] (c) {
    Subframe title:\\
    \texttt{2fnwnc5hy0}
  };
  %% Group frame
  \node[box, fit=(a)(c), inner sep=1mm] (ac) {};

  % Second node group
  %% Header
  \node[emptybox, right=of a] (a1) {\textbf{Title 1}};
  %% Subframes
  \node[box, right=of b] (b1) {
    Subframe title:\\
    \texttt{2fnwnc5hy0}
  };
  \node[emptybox, right=of c] (c1) {};
  %% Group frame
  \node[box, fit=(a1)(c1), inner sep=1mm] (ac1) {};

  % Arrow
  \draw[arrowc]
    %% Start at
    (c.west)
    %% First segment
    -| ($ (c.south west) - (5mm,3mm) $)
    %% Second segment
    -- ($ (c1.south west) - (5mm,3mm) $)
    %% Third segment
    |- (b1.west)
  ;
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Finally, this experience was not only useful for learning some new `tikz` tricks, but for working with tables as well. 
For example, I believe everyone knows that it's possible to embed `itemized` lists inside `tabularx` environment. 
However, it is possible to do the same thing with usual `tabular` environment as well!
Unfortunately, to show this example I'll need to find a solution on how to easily include TeX generated output inside html document with the possibility to add supplementary LaTeX packages.
