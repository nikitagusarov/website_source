Todays' experience with helping to submitt an article for a journal of *Taylor & Francis* group was educative and energy draining at the same time. 
Yesterday was quite a long day dedicated to styling the document, while now I had only figures to worry about. 
Later, I'll definitely have to write some guide about academic writing and how *R* software, which can be useful in this aspect. 
But now lets speak about some usefull tips in using *tikz*.

In *RMarkdown* there are several options on how to integrate *tikz* graphics into a document. 
When generating a LaTeX output, the simplest way is to embed the LaTeX code inside the document. 
While working with other formats, the only solutions is to use *tikz* environment provided by *RMarkdown*.

```
`` `{tikz, figure, fig.cap = "Figure", fig.align = "center"}
*Some figure here*
`` `
```

In order to be able to use this environment one will need to have `magick` and `pdftools` *R* packages installed. 
The first one depending on `magick++` library^[On Debian based systems `deb: libmagick++-dev`.], while the second requires `libpoppler` files to run^[On Debian based systems `deb: libpoppler-cpp-dev` work flawlessly.].
But this is not the topic for today. 

On the first place among todays' discoveries that are worth mentionning we have the possibility to place the `nodes` on drawn lines: 

```{tikz, figure, fig.cap = "Figure", fig.align = "center"}
\usetikzlibrary{
    fit,
    arrows.meta,
    mindmap,
    shadows,
    backgrounds,
    calc,
    positioning,
    shapes.misc,
    shapes.geometric
}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [box/.style = {
    rectangle,
    draw = black, 
    rounded corners, 
    minimum height={3em},
    align=left
  },
  circ/.style = {
    circle,
    draw=black, 
    fill=white,
    minimum size=3em,
    thin,
    align=center
  },node distance=5mm and 2mm
  ]
  \draw[-{stealth},very thick] (0,8) .. controls (1,4)  .. (0,0)
    node[pos=0.1, circ] (a) {1}
    node[pos=0.3, circ] (b) {2}
    node[pos=0.5, circ] (c) {3}
    node[pos=0.7, circ] (d) {4}
    node[pos=0.9, circ] (e) {5}
  ;

  \node[box, right=of a, minimum width={50mm}] (a1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (a1.west) {\textbf{Titi}\\Text};
  \node[box, right=of b, minimum width={50mm}] (b1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (b1.west) {\textbf{Tutu 2}\\Some text};
  \node[box, right=of c, minimum width={50mm}] (c1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (c1.west) {\textbf{Toto 3}\\Toto the third};
  \node[box, right=of d, minimum width={50mm}] (d1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (d1.west) {\textbf{Toto}\\More text};
  \node[box, right=of e, width={50mm}] (e1) {};
    \node[right, align=left] at (e1.west) {\textbf{Tutu}\\Text};

  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (a)--(a1);
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (b)--(b1);
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (c)--(c1);
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (d)--(d1);
  \draw[-Butt Cap,line width=5pt] (e)--(e1);
\end{tikzpicture}
```
