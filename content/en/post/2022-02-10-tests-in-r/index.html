<p>Following the previous post about the package creation in <em>R</em> we are going to dive into some details about ho to work with packages.
The first thing of interest for us is the possibility to perform tests on the package’s contents in order to control the result.
Such possibility greatly facilitates the workflow while creating a package and ensures its functionality.</p>
<div id="what-is-testthat" class="section level2">
<h2>What is <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/index.html"><code>testthat</code></a>?</h2>
<p>Focusing our attention on the <a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org/"><code>devtools</code></a> meta-package’s contents we encounter rather quickly a great number of tools to test packages.
One of the key element here is the <code>testthat</code> package, which has a number of functions to perform tests.
Among the advantages listed on the <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/index.html">project’s official webpage</a> we discover <code>testthat</code> is, as it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provides functions that make it easy to describe what you expect a function to do, including catching errors, warnings, and messages.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Easily integrates in your existing workflow, whether it’s informal testing on the command line, building test suites, or using R CMD check.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Displays test progress visually, showing a pass, fail, or error for every expectation. If you’re using the terminal or a recent version of RStudio, it’ll even colour the output.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that you probably have the <code>testthat</code> installed on your machine as a part of <code>devtools</code> package.
So, to use the package we would rather call the entire <code>devtools</code> suite:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load packages
library(devtools)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Le chargement a nécessité le package : usethis</code></pre>
<p>Nearly all the function are built over an <code>expect_</code> prefix, followed with the expected output to test for.
For example, to test whether an object returns a <code>"double"</code> we can execute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Test if double
expect_double(object_to_test, type = &quot;double&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In case when the condition is not validated, the function will output an error message.
The number of different condition and wrappers for the things to be tested is extremely large.
This allows developpers to avoid writting all testing conditions by hand, but rather use simple wrapping functions to test their code.</p>
<p>But these functions are merely a start - one should use them to <strong>automate</strong> the testing procedure.
You may ask what is the difference between the automated testing and simply testing the code in the terminal.
Effectively, the difference is tremendous, because having a hard coded and documented testing workflow in addition to good code structure and package’s documentation helps to keep track of your work.
The advantages are fairly good summarised in the <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html">R packages manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While you are testing your code in this workflow, you’re only doing it informally.
The problem with this approach is that when you come back to this code in 3 months time to add a new feature, you’ve probably forgotten some of the informal tests you ran the first time around.
This makes it very easy to break code that used to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But probably it’s eathier to understand after a short demonstration.
During this demonstration we will be using one another package alongside the <code>testthat</code> - the <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html"><code>usethis</code></a> package.
The last one offers a toolset for repetitive tasks automation for project setup and development.</p>
</div>
<div id="automated-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Automated tests</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with the automated tests demonstration we should focus create a dummy package for this purpose.
As an example, we will take the code written for the previous post.
We create a simple function and generate a package structure around it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create function
my_function = function() {
    cat(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
}

# Create package
package.skeleton(
    name = &quot;mypackage&quot;,
    list = &quot;my_function&quot;,
    path = &quot;.&quot;,
    encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards, it remains to follow the instruction as specified in the <code>Read-and-delete-me</code> file<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, generated at the root of the package’s directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the help file skeletons in <code>man</code>, possibly combining help files for multiple functions.</li>
<li>Edit the exports in <code>NAMESPACE</code>, and add necessary imports.</li>
<li>Put any C/C++/Fortran code in <code>src</code>.</li>
<li>If you have compiled code, add a <code>useDynLib()</code> directive to <code>NAMESPACE</code>.</li>
<li>Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.</li>
<li>Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now we are going to ignore most of these steps.
There is only one function, which does not require any supplementary documentation for testing purposes.
The <code>NAMESPACE</code> does not require any modification in terms of necessary imports and we have no compiled code in <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>.
We may remove this file with command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove Read-and-delete-me
file.remove(&quot;./mypackage/Read-and-delete-me&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Nevertheless, before building the package we would like to create some automated testing procedure.
For example we may deside to verify the ouput of our function.
in order to do so, we should create an automated template for our tests with <code>usethis</code> (there is no need to specify namespace separately, because the <code>usethis</code> package is loaded as part of <code>devtools</code> meta-package):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Move to package location
setwd(&quot;mypackage&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Using testthat
usethis::use_testthat()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✔ Setting active project to &#39;/home/nikita/Documents/Personal/website_source/content/en/post/2022-02-10-tests-in-r/mypackage&#39;
## ✔ Adding &#39;testthat&#39; to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
## ✔ Setting Config/testthat/edition field in DESCRIPTION to &#39;3&#39;
## ✔ Creating &#39;tests/testthat/&#39;
## ✔ Writing &#39;tests/testthat.R&#39;
## • Call `use_test()` to initialize a basic test file and open it for editing.</code></pre>
<p>This function will create a new <code>tests</code> folder in our package’s directory.
The folder contains a <code>testthat</code> subfolder and a <code>testthat.R</code> script.
The <code>.R</code> script will execute the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>library(testthat)
library(mypackage)

test_check(&quot;mypackage&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Which means that the testing script will load required dependencies and the package to test.
Then the serie of test will be executed.
Once the main testing framework is generated, it remains to aliment it with the unit tests, which can be done with the command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create test file for my_function
use_test(&quot;my_function&quot;, open = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✔ Writing &#39;tests/testthat/test-my_function.R&#39;
## • Edit &#39;tests/testthat/test-my_function.R&#39;</code></pre>
<p>By convention, this function will create a <code>test-my_function.R</code> file to contain all the tests related to the <code>my_function()</code> object.
The file will be stored under <code>./tests/testthat</code> directory.
Afterwards, it remains only to edit the contents of the testing file to verify the desired behaviour.
For example, we may decide to test whether the function’s output is exactly <code>"\nHello world!\n"</code> with <code>expect_output()</code> function.
To do so, we write following lines to the file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Write contents
cat(
    &quot;test_that(&#39;output_hello_world&#39;, {&quot;,
    &quot;   expect_output(&quot;,
    &quot;       my_function(),&quot;,
    &quot;       regexp = &#39;Hello world!&#39;&quot;,
    &quot;   )&quot;,
    &quot;})&quot;, 
    file = &quot;tests/testthat/test-my_function.R&quot;,
    sep = &quot;\n&quot;,
    append = FALSE
)</code></pre>
<p>Once the tests configured, we may run the testing job with a command from <code>devtools</code> namespace.
But before it we are going to clear our workspace, don’t forget that we still have our function attached to the running session:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rm(list = c(&quot;my_function&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Now, when everything is ready, execute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Run tests
test()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ℹ Loading mypackage</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ℹ Testing mypackage</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✔ | F W S  OK | Context
## 
⠏ |         0 | my_function                              
✔ |         1 | my_function
## 
## ══ Results ══════════════════════════════════════════════
## [ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 1 ]</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the tests are passed without errors.
Which means that <code>my_function()</code> output exactly corresponds to the desired <code>"Hello world!"</code> statement.
But were we to modify the test for checking whether the output is <code>"Big white cat"</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Write contents
cat(
    &quot;test_that(&#39;output_hello_world&#39;, {&quot;,
    &quot;   expect_output(&quot;,
    &quot;       my_function(),&quot;,
    &quot;       regexp = &#39;Big white cat&#39;&quot;,
    &quot;   )&quot;,
    &quot;})&quot;, 
    file = &quot;tests/testthat/test-my_function.R&quot;,
    sep = &quot;\n&quot;,
    append = FALSE
)</code></pre>
<p>And run the testing procedure:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Run tests
test()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ℹ Loading mypackage</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ℹ Testing mypackage</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✔ | F W S  OK | Context
## 
⠏ |         0 | my_function                              
✖ | 1       0 | my_function
## ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Failure (test-my_function.R:2:4): output_hello_world
## `my_function\(\)` does not match &quot;Big white cat&quot;.
## Actual value: &quot;Hello world!&quot;
## Backtrace:
##  1. testthat::expect_output(my_function(), regexp = &quot;Big white cat&quot;)
##       at test-my_function.R:2:3
##  2. testthat::expect_match(...)
##  3. testthat:::expect_match_(...)
## ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 
## ══ Results ══════════════════════════════════════════════
## [ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]</code></pre>
<p>One failed test would be detected, because the values do not match.</p>
<p>Once you become familiar with the test procedures setup, you may proceed with more complex tasks.
For example, it may be interesting to configure a <em>Continuous Integration</em> (CI) workflow to run all the test externally on a dedicated server.</p>
