The third year of my PhD is arriving at it's end and now all my forces are focused on the final manuscript writing, 
alongside with several side projects (done in collaboration with other PhD students). 
My experience of updating the blog on everyday basis at the start of February 2022 was more distracting from the work than I though, 
although it helped to keep the *writing-oriented* state of mind.
This time, in order to boost my writing productivity I'll attempt to return here more often with work related and personal updates. 

Nearly a year and a half have elapsed from the last blogpost here, due to quite a lot of complications in scientific and personal life. 
The most disturbing and time consuming part was the attempted stay at the Data Intelligence Lab in Montréal, Canada.
Definitely the 6 month period to obtain a simple visitor VISA is not normal and ruins a lot of personal and professional plans. 
What is more, the terribly organised VISA issuing procedure has further impacted my professional life by ruining my participation in a WCTRS-Y 2023 conference at Montréal.
But this is a story for another time. 

Now I'll attempt to gradually retake control over my blog and start posting some new materials. 
Stay tuned!
